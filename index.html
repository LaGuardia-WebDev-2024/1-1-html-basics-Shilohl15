<hi> Red Flower</hi>

  <p> A poem (soon to be song) that highlights a beautiful red flower.<br>
    That flower doesn't realize how amazingly red its petals are so in turn it criticizes itself. </p>
  <p>
    Flower why do you criticize your bright red petals<br>
    You outshine all the little daffodils that tell you you're too bright<br>
    Youre pretty stature and stance knocks all the boring little daffodils out of the park<br>
    But the most important thing I have to say is dont let that crunchy leaf tell you you're too bright<br>
